# PTFEM
Matlab code for FE analysis under 2D axisymmetric stress condition.

All scripts should be in the same directory, and the main program is 'axisymmetric.m'

This is just for fun, everyone can use it free.

You can contact me by my persional email: j.tu20130227@gmail.com.

Happy to answer any questions relate to these scripts.
